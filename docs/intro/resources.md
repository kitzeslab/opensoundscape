## Bioacoustics

* [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/): a question & answer board about bioacoustic research and techniques.
* [Bioacoustics Software Database](https://rhine3.github.io/bioacoustics-software/software/): a list of free and paid software available for bioacoustic analyses
* Our lab's [Bioacoustics Cookbook](https://github.com/kitzeslab/bioacoustics-cookbook/tree/main) contains "recipes" for various bioacoustics workflows and problems, including:
    - machine learning and model training examples
    - classifier-guided listening
    - calculating sunrise and sunset times
    - filtering AudioMoth files by date and time
    - converting between GPS coordinate systems
    - creating a grid of points as a KML file.
* Bioacoustic datasets:
    - Dan Morris's compilation (scroll down to "Bioacoustic data sets"): https://lila.science/otherdatasets
    - Justin Salamon's compilation: https://bioacousticsdatasets.weebly.com/
    - Competitions related to bioacoustic data: https://lila.science/otherdatasets#competitions-acoustic
* [Bioacoustics Model Zoo](https://github.com/kitzeslab/bioacoustics-model-zoo): Pre-trained machine learning models for bioacoustic classification tasks, usable with OpenSoundscape
    
## Conservation technology

* [WILDLABS.net](https://wildlabs.net): a discussion board for general-purpose conservation technology
* [Conservation Tech Directory](https://conservationtech.directory/): A general-purpose list of conservation tech resources which contains many bioacoustic resources
* [AudioMoth Guide](https://github.com/rhine3/audiomoth-guide): our lab's practical guide for how to use the AudioMoth acoustic recorder
