OpenSoundscape
==============

OpenSoundscape  (`GitHub <https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape>`_) is free and open source software for the analysis of bioacoustic recordings. Its main goals are to allow users to train their own custom species classification models using a variety of frameworks (including convolutional neural networks) and to use trained models to predict whether species are present in field recordings. OpSo can be installed and run on a single computer or in a cluster or cloud environment.

OpenSoundcape is developed and maintained by the `Kitzes Lab <http://www.kitzeslab.org/>`_ at the University of Pittsburgh.

The Getting Started section below provide guidance on installing OpSo. The Tutorials pages below are written as Jupyter Notebooks that can also be downloaded from the `project repository <http://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape/>`_ on GitHub.
