## The below job installs opensoundscape on a windows machine using WSL.
## It is commented out, as it keeps hanging on the final step 'Poetry run pytest'
## even if only one test (that passes) is run instead of whole suite (e.g. run pytest tests/test_helpers.py)
## the job hangs and is eventually auto-killed by the github runner.
