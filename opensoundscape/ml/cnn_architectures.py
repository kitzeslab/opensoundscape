"""Module to initialize PyTorch CNN architectures with custom output shape

This module allows the use of several built-in CNN architectures from PyTorch.
The architecture refers to the specific layers and layer input/output shapes
(including convolution sizes and strides, etc) - such as the ResNet18 or
Inception V3 architecture.

We provide wrappers which modify the output layer to the desired shape
(to match the number of classes). The way to change the output layer
shape depends on the architecture, which is why we need a wrapper for each one.
This code is based on
pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html

To use these wrappers, for example, if your
model has 10 output classes, write

`my_arch=resnet18(10)`

Then you can initialize a model object from
`opensoundscape.ml.cnn` with your architecture:

`model=CNN(my_arch,classes,sample_duration)`

or override an existing model's architecture:

`model.network = my_arch`

Note: the InceptionV3 architecture must be used differently than other
architectures - the easiest way is to simply use the InceptionV3 class in
opensoundscape.ml.cnn.
